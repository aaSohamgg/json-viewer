The company is developing a hybrid AI approach that integrates electronic health record (EHR) data with traditional underwriting expertise. \n\nThis system allows for the creation of data science models focused on mortality, which provide initial assessments that underwriters can refine using additional information. This collaboration between AI and human underwriters ensures transparency and accuracy in risk assessment, moving away from \"black box\" models.\n\nFurthermore, New York Life is exploring the use of generative AI to enhance various operational aspects, including underwriting, customer service, and recruitment. By digitizing the underwriting process, the company has significantly reduced the time required for decisions, transforming what was once a multi-week process into one that can yield results in just days or hours. \n\nThis focus on AI not only streamlines operations but also supports New York Life's commitment to providing personalized and effective service to its clients, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience.\n"
